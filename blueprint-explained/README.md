Flask Blueprint is a feature in the Flask web framework that allows you to organize your application into reusable and modular components. It helps in creating larger applications by breaking them down into smaller, self-contained modules, or blueprints, which can be registered and used by the main Flask application.

A Flask Blueprint defines a collection of routes, templates, static files, and other application resources that are grouped together based on a specific functionality or feature. It allows you to define routes and views in a separate blueprint object, which can later be registered with the main Flask application.

Flask blueprints are particularly useful when you want to break down your application into multiple modules or when you want to reuse a set of routes and views across different Flask applications. They provide a clean and organized way to structure your Flask application.

In the myblueprint.py file, we import the Blueprint class from Flask. We create an instance of the blueprint called my_blueprint and define a route /blueprint using the @my_blueprint.route() decorator. The corresponding view function blueprint_route() returns a simple message.
